To launch a node in the OpenStack CI account (production servers)::

  . openstackci-rs-nova.sh

To launch a node in the OpenStack Jenkins account (slave nodes)::

  . openstackjenkins-rs-nova.sh

Then::

  puppet cert generate servername.openstack.org
  ./launch-node.py servername.openstack.org --cert servername.openstack.org.pem

If you are launching a replacement server, you may skip the generate
step and specify the name of an existing puppet cert (as long as the
private key is on this host).

The server name and cert names may be different.

Manually add the hostname to DNS (the launch script does not do so
automatically).
