Create Server
=============

Note that these instructions assume you're working from this
directory on an updated local clone of the repository on the
puppetmaster, and that your account is a member of the admin
and puppet groups for access to their respective keys::

  sudo adduser $(whoami) admin
  sudo adduser $(whoami) puppet

(Remember to log out and back into your shell if you add yourself
to a group.)

Launching a node currently requires a different version of ansible
than what is generally used on the puppetmaster.  Set up a
virtualenv::

  virtualenv ~/launch-env/
  . ~/launch-env/bin/activate
  pip install ansible==2.1.1.0 shade==1.12.1

To launch a node in the OpenStack CI account (production servers)::

  . ~/launch-env/bin/activate
  export PROVIDER_DEFAULTS=rax-prod
  export FQDN=servername01.openstack.org
  cd /opt/system-config/production/launch/
  ./launch-node.py $FQDN

To launch a node in the OpenStack Jenkins account (slave nodes)::

  . ~/launch-env/bin/activate
  export PROVIDER_DEFAULTS=rax-slave
  export FQDN=slavename01.slave.openstack.org
  ./launch-node.py $FQDN rax-slave

See the definition of PROVIDER_DETAILS for keys to use other
providers.  Note command-line flags will override any defaults.

Manually add the hostname to DNS (the launch script does not do so
automatically). Note that this example assumes you've already
exported a relevant FQDN and sourced the appropriate API credentials
above.

In order for Ansible to be able to send out the Puppet updates,
you also need the puppetmaster to accept the root SSH key for the
new server. So as root on the puppetmaster:

  ssh root@$FQDN

Verify the fingerprint of the new server and type "yes" to accept.
Then you can log out.

Add DNS Records
===============

There are no scripts to automatically handle DNS at the moment due to
a lack of library support for the new Rackspace Cloud DNS (with IPv6).
However, the launch-node script will print the commands needed to be
run to configure DNS for a newly launched server.  To see the commands
for an existing server, run:

  ./dns.py $FQDN
