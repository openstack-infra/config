# TODO(clarkb) Find a way to make this a global default
# currently restricted to mirror.yaml because we are trying to
# boot a new mirror on xenial which doesn't have python2 by
# default. Can't just set it to python3 globally without some
# work due to Trusty and Centos not coming with ansible supported
# python3 (>=3.5).
