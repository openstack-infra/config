letsencrypt-install-txt-record
==============================

Install

**Role Variables**

.. zuul:rolevar:: acme_txt_required

   A global dictionary of TXT records to be installed.  This is
   generated by the ``letsencrypt-request-certs`` role.

   Records are installed into ``acme.opendev.org`` and the nameserver
   is refreshed.

   After this, ``letsencrypt-create-certs`` can run on each host to
   provision the certificates.
