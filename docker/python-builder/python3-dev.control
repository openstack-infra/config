# The python:slim base image already has python headers
# installed, but they are installed from source. This will
# be used to create a dummy package so that things that
# say they need python3-dev won't actually install an
# entire python that is unneeded.

Priority: optional
Standards-Version: 2.3.3

Package: python3-dev
# Set the version to 4.0.0 so that it'll always be a greater
# version than any version of python3-dev in the archive.
