#
# Test system-config roles/*
#
# This playbook should use and test roles defined in the system-config
# top-level roles/* directory.  These roles should be generic enough
# to run under Zuul (here) and also directly under Ansible for the
# control-plane (see system-config-run-base)
#
# Note playbooks should by default use the "base" node (i.e. hosts:
# base); some roles (like puppet) may also use another node if they're
# testing an alternative path.

# Logrotate for a file
- import_playbook: logrotate.yaml

# Puppet installation
- import_playbook: puppet-install.yaml

# Kerberos & afs roles
- import_playbook: openafs-client.yaml
