# Test system-config roles/*
#
# This playbook should use and test roles defined in the system-config
# top-level roles/* directory.  These roles should be generic enough
# to run under Zuul (here) and also directly under Ansible for the
# control-plane (see system-config-run-base)
#

# Kerberos & afs roles
