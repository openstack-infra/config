OpenStack Continuous Integration
================================

This documentation covers the installation and maintenance of the
Continuous Integration (CI) infrastructure used by OpenStack.  It
may be of interest to people who may want to help develop this
infrastructure or integrate their tools into it.  Some instructions
may be useful to other projects that want to set up similar CI
systems.

OpenStack developers or users do not need to read this documentation.
Instead, see http://wiki.openstack.org/ to learn how contribute to or
