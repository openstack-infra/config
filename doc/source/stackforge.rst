StackForge
##########

StackForge was a way that OpenStack related projects can consume and
make use of the OpenStack project infrastructure. This includes Gerrit
code review, Jenkins continuous integration, GitHub repository
mirroring, and various small things like IRC bots, pypi uploads, RTFD
updates. We have since retired StackForge and now ask that all projects
get created under ``openstack/``. Details for this retirement can be found
at http://governance.openstack.org/resolutions/20150615-stackforge-retirement.html

Note that this change is meant to convey that projects contained within
it are hosted on OpenStack infrastructure. Only some of the projects
within will be official OpenStack projects themselves.
