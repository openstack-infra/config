Logstash
########

Overview
========

Logs from Jenkins test runs are sent to logstash where they are
indexed and stored.  Logstash facilitates reviewing logs from mulitple
sources in a single test run, searching for errors or particular
events within a test run, as well as searching for log event trends
across test runs.

The OpenStak logstash server is at
`<http://logstash.openstack.org/>`_.
