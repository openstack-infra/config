# This file is used by the notify_impact jeepyb plugin to control the bugs it
# create.
#
# Please keep these structures in alphabetical order.

# For automatically created DocImpact bugs, there are two structures here. The
# author_map maps email addresses of authors to "groups". These groups can be
# anything you want, although the most likely example is a dev team at a
# particular company. The second structure is "subscriber_map", which lists
# the people to subscribe to a bug owned by a particular group.
