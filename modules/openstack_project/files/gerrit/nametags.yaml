# This file contains a mapping of project->tag->branch, used to configure
# lightweight tags which get automatically updated so that they always follow
# the tip of the specified branch for that project.

# The "defaults" metaproject contains a set of common default tag:branch pairs
# which can be included and overridden in actual individual projects.
defaults: &defaults
  xyzzy: master

# The test project gets the default tags, but adds a plover tag following the
# br1 branch and a plugh tag following the br2 branch.
test:
  <<: *defaults
  plover: br1
  plugh: br2

# The test2 project only inherits the defaults (a xyzzy tag following the
# master branch).
test2:
  <<: *defaults
