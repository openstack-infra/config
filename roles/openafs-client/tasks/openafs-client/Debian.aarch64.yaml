# ARM64 Bionic missed having fixes in before release.  It is first
# supported in openafs 1.8.1; there are some proposed updates now
# upstream has support merged and released.  To remove this gate, we
# should ideally be able to grab the packages from upstream, or
# otherwise have tested this somewhere other than Xenial.  This is
# left as future work.
