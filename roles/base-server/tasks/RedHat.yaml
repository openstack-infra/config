# NOTE(pabelanger): We need to ensure ntpdate service starts on boot for
# centos-7.  Currently, ntpd explicitly require ntpdate to be running before
# the sync process can happen in ntpd.  As a result, if ntpdate is not
# running, ntpd will start but fail to sync because of DNS is not properly
# setup.
